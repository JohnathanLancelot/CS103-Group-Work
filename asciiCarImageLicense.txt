Changes have been made by Johnathan Worrall to the original image (this is a derivative). Acute accents have been changed to 
apostrophes (accute accents were not found to be compatible with Visual Studio), o's have been added to the wheels, a box 
shape has been added to the top of the car to make it look like a taxi, and a P has been added insted of a second bracket to 
indicate a side mirror.
